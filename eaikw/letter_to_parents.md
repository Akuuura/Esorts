# A Letter To Parents: What Your Children Will See
## October 14, 2025

*I'm a parent and an educator. I need to tell you what's coming for your kids. This isn't speculation. This is based on what's happening right now, today.*

## Your 2-Year-Old (Born 2023)

**What they'll see by age 7 (2030):**

Your child starts first grade. Their teacher is exhausted because the school laid off two teachers last year. Class size went from 22 kids to 34 kids. The school can't afford supplies anymore.

You lost your job at the warehouse. A robot took it. You've been looking for work for eight months. You're stressed all the time. Your kid can feel it even if they don't understand why.

Their friend's dad drives for Amazon. Except he doesn't anymore. Self-driving trucks took that job last year. That friend moved away because their family couldn't afford rent.

McDonald's where you used to take them for treats? Fully automated now. Order on a screen, robots cook it, robot brings it out. No people working there except one manager.

Your kid asks why you're home so much now. You don't know what to say.

**What they'll see by age 12 (2035):**

Middle school. But it's not the middle school you remember. 

The building is falling apart. No repairs in five years. Teacher left to work at a private school where rich kids go. They have small classes and new computers and actual field trips.

Your kid's school has 45 kids per class. They watch video lessons most of the day because there aren't enough teachers. The few teachers left are just babysitters now.

Your kid is smart. Could be a doctor, an engineer, anything. But you can't afford any of it. College? That's only for rich kids now. Even the state schools cost $80,000 a year.

Healthcare? You haven't been to a dentist in three years. Your kid's tooth hurts but you're waiting, hoping it gets better. It won't.

Your kid asks what they should be when they grow up. You don't have a good answer anymore.

**What they'll see by age 16 (2039):**

High school. They're starting to understand what happened.

Half their friends' parents don't work. Not because they're lazy - there just aren't jobs. Robots and AI took them. The only people with jobs are either:
- Working for rich people (servants, basically)
- Doing gig work for almost nothing
- Or they got lucky and have family money

Your kid is starting to notice the divide. Some kids show up in nice clothes, new phones, talk about family vacations. Those kids' parents own things - businesses, property, investments. They own the robots.

Most kids show up in worn-out clothes. Free lunch. Worried looks. Those kids' parents work for the rich kids' parents. If they're lucky.

Your kid meets someone at school. Falls for them. That person's family has money. Your kid goes to their house once. Never again. Your kid sees what they don't have. Sees what they'll never have. Something breaks inside them.

Your kid asks why life is so unfair. You finally tell them the truth.

## Your 4-Year-Old (Born 2021)

**What they'll see by age 9 (2030):**

Fourth grade. They're old enough to notice things now.

They notice you working two gig jobs just to keep the lights on. They notice you skip meals sometimes. Say you're "not hungry." They know you're lying.

They notice their best friend from preschool goes to a different school now. A private school. They don't see that friend anymore. Different worlds.

They notice the store down the street closed. And the other one. And the restaurant where you used to go for birthdays. All closed. Or all robots now.

They ask for things they see other kids have. You say "we can't afford that right now." They hear "we can't afford that" a lot. They stop asking.

**What they'll see by age 14 (2035):**

They're getting angry. They understand more now. They understand that:

- You did everything right (worked hard, followed the rules)
- It didn't matter
- The game was rigged
- And it's too late to change it

They understand that their smart friend who could've been anything? Working at a grocery store. If they're lucky. Most stores don't hire people anymore.

They understand that diploma they're working toward? Worthless. College? Forget it. Even if they could afford it, degrees don't lead to jobs anymore. There are no jobs.

They understand that some of their friends are making money now. Not good ways. Desperate ways. Things you told them never to do. But those kids have phones, clothes, food. Your kid is starting to understand why.

They ask you "Did you know this was coming?" 

You don't know how to answer.

**What they'll see by age 18 (2039):**

They graduate high school. Now what?

College isn't an option. Trade school maybe, but even electricians and plumbers are getting squeezed by robots now. Not gone yet, but going.

Military? Sure, if they want. Military is hiring. Because enforcing order is one job that still needs humans. For now.

Their options:
1. Work service jobs for rich people (if they can get one)
2. Gig economy (driving, delivering, whatever's left - for pennies)
3. Give up (drugs are cheap, deaths of despair are everywhere)
4. Get creative (OnlyFans, sex work, selling dignity)
5. Crime (desperate people do desperate things)

They look at you and ask "Why didn't you stop this?"

You have no answer.

## Your 7-Year-Old (Born 2018)

**What they'll see by age 12 (2030):**

They remember the "before times" a little. When you had a job. When things were normal.

They remember when their teacher actually taught them things instead of just supervising them watching videos.

They remember when there were adults working at stores and restaurants. Now it's just robots and screens.

They're in middle school now. Starting to understand economics. Starting to understand they're poor. Starting to understand that matters.

They have a crush on someone. That person's family has money. Your kid knows it won't work. Different worlds. Like a caste system. 

They're starting to get bitter.

**What they'll see by age 17 (2035):**

Junior year. They're smart. They could do great things. In a different world.

They watch rich kids talk about college plans. Gap years. Internships at dad's company. Guaranteed futures.

They watch their friends talk about which gig apps pay best. Which rich neighborhoods need servants. Who's hiring for under-the-table work.

They watch the news talk about "economic growth" and "stock market highs." They know what that means now. It means rich people got richer. Again.

They watch politicians talk about "opportunity" and "hard work" and "American dream." They know those are lies now. Those things don't exist anymore. Not for people like them.

They ask you "Is there any point to any of this?"

You don't have a good answer.

## Your 12-Year-Old (Born 2013)

**What they're seeing right now (2025):**

They're old enough to notice things are changing. Fast.

They notice you're worried about work. They heard you on the phone talking about "automation" and "layoffs."

They notice stores are different now. More self-checkout. Fewer workers. Their friend's mom who worked at Target? Doesn't anymore.

They're in middle school. Starting to think about their future. What they want to be.

Doctor? Their teacher says that's really hard now, really expensive. 
Lawyer? AI does a lot of that now.
Teacher? Schools are cutting teachers, class sizes going up.
Nurse? Maybe. One of the few jobs left.

They're starting to feel uncertain about the future. They're not wrong.

**What they'll see by age 17 (2030):**

Junior year. College prep year. Except there's no point.

They watched their older cousin graduate college two years ago. Degree in business. Working at a coffee shop now. $30,000 in debt. Living with parents.

They watched you lose your job. Watched you struggle to find another one. Watched you take gig work for a fraction of what you used to make.

They watched half the businesses in town close or go full-robot. Watched their friends' parents lose jobs. Watched families move away, double up in apartments, break apart.

They understand now. They're not going to have the life you had. They're not going to have anything close to it.

They've stopped talking to you about the future. What's the point?

## Your 16-Year-Old (Born 2009)

**What they're seeing right now (2025):**

They're applying to colleges. They see the prices. They do the math. They understand what debt means.

They look at the news. They're old enough to understand what's happening:
- Mass layoffs blamed on "efficiency"
- AI replacing jobs
- Government cutting programs
- Rich people getting richer
- Argentina taking $20 billion while US government is shut down

They ask you "Is this real? Is this really happening?"

You tell them yes.

**What they'll see by age 21 (2030):**

They're in college if you went into massive debt. Or they're not, and they're working whatever jobs still exist.

Either way, they're watching the world collapse in real-time:

- Friend from high school? Dead. Fentanyl overdose. One of thousands.
- Friend from childhood? Sex worker now. Not by choice. By necessity.
- Friend who joined the military? Stationed at the border. Won't talk about what they do there.
- Friend who was going to be a teacher? Gave up. Schools are falling apart, teachers aren't paid enough to survive.

They see articles about billionaires hitting trillion-dollar net worths. Same week they see articles about record homelessness, record hunger, record deaths of despair.

They understand completely now. 

This isn't a temporary problem. This is permanent. This is the new world.

They look at you and ask "Why didn't your generation stop this when you could?"

## The Hard Truth

Here's what I need you to understand as a parent:

**This timeline is based on current policies and current trends. This is where we're headed RIGHT NOW.**

Your kids will live in a world where:
- Labor has no value (robots do it cheaper)
- Education has no value (no jobs that need it)
- Hard work has no value (no jobs to work hard at)
- The only thing that matters is whether you OWN things or SERVE people who own things

**In ancient Rome, there were two classes:**
- Citizens (owned property, had rights, had dignity)
- Everyone else (slaves, servants, plebs - survived on scraps and charity)

**We're going back to that. Except instead of slaves doing the work, robots do it.**

And your kids? Unless you're already rich, they're going to be in the "everyone else" category.

## What History Tells Us

Every time in history when:
- Wealth concentrates at the top
- Middle class disappears  
- Labor loses value
- Government weakens
- Control systems strengthen

**The same thing happens:**

**For the poor:**
- Desperation
- Substance abuse (currently killing 100,000+ Americans per year, accelerating)
- Selling dignity to survive (sex work explodes)
- Selling body to survive (organ black markets)
- Crime (what choice is there?)
- Early death (deaths of despair, currently life expectancy DROPPING in America)

**For society:**
- Brutal inequality (90% have nothing, 10% have everything, 0.1% have almost all of it)
- Social breakdown (no community when everyone is desperate)
- Authoritarianism (need strong control when population is desperate)
- Violence (desperate people do desperate things)
- Collapse (eventually, it always collapses)

**This has happened before:**
- Late Rome
- Pre-revolutionary France  
- Pre-revolutionary Russia
- Gilded Age America
- 1930s Germany

**It always ends the same way. Badly.**

## What's Different This Time

Throughout history, when things got bad enough, regular people had one card to play:

**"You need us. You need our labor. You need us to work. So you have to treat us with some minimum decency."**

That card is gone.

With AI and robots, they don't need your labor anymore. They don't need millions of workers. They need:
- A small number of highly skilled technicians
- A moderate number of servants (human servants as status symbols)
- A large number of desperate people competing for scraps

**Your kids are being positioned to be in that third category.**

And there's nothing you can do to stop it by yourself. Individual action won't save your kids. This is systemic.

You can't:
- Work harder (there are no jobs)
- Get more education (education doesn't lead to jobs anymore)
- Move somewhere better (it's happening everywhere)
- Start a business (compete with robots? with billionaire-funded mega-corporations?)

**The only thing that could change this is collective action. Government action. Policy changes. And that's not happening.**

Instead:
- Government is being weakened (on purpose)
- Programs are being cut (on purpose)
- Rich people are being given more money (on purpose)
- Control systems are being strengthened (on purpose)

**They're building the cage before your kids realize they're being caged.**

## Look At Argentina Right Now

October 2025. Argentina is the test case. They're doing it openly:

**What they did:**
- Fired 52,000 government workers
- Cut programs for regular people
- Cut regulations
- Cut protections
- Given tax cuts to rich people

**Results so far:**
- 11 million people in poverty (out of 46 million total)
- Rich people doing GREAT
- "Economy growing" (stock market up, GDP up)
- Regular people suffering

**And on October 9, 2025, DURING OUR GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, we gave them $20 billion and said "keep going."**

That tells you everything.

That's the model. That's the plan. Do that here.

**And your kids will live in that world.**

## What You Need To Tell Your Kids

Don't lie to them. Don't give them false hope. They need to understand what's coming.

**Tell them:**

"The world is changing in a way that's never happened before. Robots and AI are going to do most jobs. This could have been great - everyone could have more time, more freedom, nobody would have to work so hard.

But the people with money and power decided to keep all the benefits for themselves. They're making sure the robots make THEM richer, and regular people get nothing.

Your generation is going to live in a world where most people have very little, and a few people have almost everything. Where being born poor means staying poor. Where education doesn't matter because there are no jobs. Where hard work doesn't matter because robots do it cheaper.

I'm sorry. My generation should have stopped this. We didn't. And now it might be too late.

I don't know what to tell you about your future. I don't know what opportunities will exist for you. I don't know if you'll be able to have the life I had.

What I do know is that you're going to need each other. Community. Family. Friends. Because when systems fail, all you have is people.

And I do know that this isn't forever. These systems collapse. They always do. Maybe your generation will build something better from the ruins.

I'm sorry I couldn't protect you from this."

**That's the truth. That's what's coming.**

## One More Thing

You might be thinking "This is too dark. Too extreme. It can't be this bad."

**Look around. It's already starting:**

- Life expectancy in America is DROPPING (first time in modern history outside of war)
- Deaths of despair are EXPLODING (overdoses, suicides, alcoholism)
- Homelessness is ACCELERATING (even people with jobs can't afford housing)
- Education costs are CRUSHING (entire generation in debt)
- Healthcare bankruptcies are NORMAL (one illness destroys families)
- Income inequality is HIGHEST it's been in 100 years (and accelerating)
- Social mobility is DEAD (born poor, die poor)
- Government is WEAKENING (shutdowns, cuts, dysfunction)
- Authoritarianism is RISING (more police, more prisons, more control)

**This isn't coming. It's here. It's just going to get much, much worse.**

And your kids are going to live through it.
