## Full Event Description

### AI and What's at Stake: A Town Hall

**Join me for an honest conversation about AI‚Äîno hype, no fear-mongering, no oversimplification.**

I've been building systems for 43 years. Started on a TRS-80 in 1982. Former CTO. Current Director of the BS in Enterprise AI program at NJIT. I've seen enough technology waves to know what matters.

This isn't a sales pitch. It's a conversation about what you need to know.

**‚ö° Live Demonstrations (20 min)**
- Building production AI systems in real-time
- RAG systems, knowledge graphs, testing, CI/CD‚Äînot toy code
- "Vibe coding" for production: How deep knowledge + AI = superpower

**üíº What's Actually at Stake (20 min)**
- Job displacement (the truth is more nuanced than you think)
- Education system crisis (we're teaching yesterday's skills)
