                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <ul class="background-facts">
                        <li><strong>Since 2007:</strong> Director of Web & Information Systems Program, NJIT—courses acknowledged by Fortune 500 companies as "best undergraduate courses for junior software development positions in the United States"</li>
                        <li><strong>2013-2017:</strong> CTO, Anthiem Ventures—built Showd.me (peer-to-peer learning platform) and WrkBench (real-time collaboration tool), managed distributed teams across US, India, Vietnam</li>
                        <li><strong>Since 2003:</strong> Owner, Webizly—developed systems for NJ Talent Network, medical billing solutions, statewide nurse engagement platforms</li>
                        <li><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python (46%), PHP (37%), JavaScript (10%), TypeScript—frameworks include FastAPI, Flask, Django, React, Vue, Next.js, LangChain; infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, Terraform</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Teaching & Recognition</h3>
                    <ul class="background-facts">
                        <li>Created courses in AGILE project management, web/mobile development, distributed systems, cloud architecture—core curriculum for multiple CS majors</li>
                        <li>Students placed at Amazon (23 connections), JPMorgan Chase (22), Microsoft, Google, major financial institutions</li>

                    <h3>Why Everyday AI?</h3>
                    <p>Most AI content is either technical papers no one reads or hype from vendors selling products. I've spent 43 years building production systems and 22 years teaching—I've seen dot-com bubble, cloud hype, mobile-first, now AI. I know what lasts and what doesn't.</p>
                    <p><strong>These town halls have no agenda except reality.</strong> No products to sell. No doom prophecies. Just honest conversation about what's happening based on data, experience, and what actually works in production.</p>

                    <h3>Here's Why I'm Uniquely Positioned (And Maybe a Little Dangerous 😏)</h3>
                    <p>Look, I learned programming the hard way. Started at age 7 on a TRS-80 in 1982—before Stack Overflow existed, before GitHub, definitely before ChatGPT. Just me, a manual that weighed more than I did, and a lot of frustrated typing.</p>
                    <p><strong>All those years of doing things the hard way? Turns out that's my superpower now.</strong></p>
                    <p>Because when you combine <em>43 years of hard-won knowledge</em> with <em>AI amplification</em>, you become something rare: someone who knows <strong>what to ask for</strong>, <strong>what's actually possible</strong>, and <strong>what's complete bullshit</strong>. (And trust me, there's a LOT of bullshit out there right now.)</p>

                            <h4>I'm Fast Now. Like, Scary Fast.</h4>
                            <p>I can architect systems in hours that used to take weeks—because I actually know what I'm building toward. Junior devs with AI write more code faster. Cool. I write the <em>right code</em> faster. There's a difference.</p>

                            <h4>43 Years of "I've Seen This Movie Before"</h4>
                            <p>You know that gut feeling when something's about to break? That's 43 years of pattern recognition. AI helps me query my mental database of "what fails and why" instantly. I spot problems in your architecture before you deploy it.</p>

                            <h4>I Know What Questions to Ask</h4>
                            <p>Most people treat AI like a magic 8-ball. I treat it like a really smart junior engineer who needs clear direction. There's a skill to that. I know what's possible, what's fantasy, and what's a vendor trying to sell you something that doesn't exist yet.</p>

                            <h4>My BS Detector Works Overtime</h4>
                            <p>When AI hallucinates, I catch it instantly. When vendors pitch "revolutionary AI solutions," I can tell you which parts are real and which parts are marketing. When hype drowns out reality, I'm the guy going "Okay, but does it actually WORK?"</p>

                    <h3>Practice Builds Theory</h3>
                    <p>I started coding at age 7 on a TRS-80. I believe in learning by building, not theorizing endlessly. Theory without practice is philosophy. Practice without theory is chaos. AI helps me bridge both—fast.</p>

                    <h3>Education Must Evolve</h3>
                    <p>The gap between academic AI courses and what companies actually need is enormous. We're fixing that at NJIT—teaching students to think like engineers who've been doing this for decades, but with AI tools from day one.</p>

                    <h3>AI Ethics Are Critical</h3>
                    <p>Bias, displacement, power concentration—these aren't side issues. They're the main event. I've seen enough technology cycles to know: the people who build responsibly win in the long run.</p>

                    <h3>Societal Impact Matters</h3>
                    <p>AI will reshape work, education, and economic structures. We need honest conversations, not hype. I'm old enough to remember when "the internet will replace everything" was said with the same breathless certainty. Some things changed. Some didn't. Let's think clearly.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>So What Does This Mean for You?</h3>
                <p><strong>If you're running a company:</strong> You get someone who can architect AI systems that actually work in production—not just pretty demos. I've been shipping code for 43 years. AI just makes me faster and more creative, not sloppier.</p>
                <p><strong>If you're a student:</strong> You learn from someone who made all the mistakes already (trust me, I made a LOT of them). You get the foundations that matter, taught by someone who learned the hard way so you don't have to. Plus I'll probably tell you some stories that aren't in the textbook.</p>
                <p><strong>If you're just trying to make sense of AI:</strong> You get honest talk. No hype. No doom-saying. No oversimplification. Just someone who's lived through enough tech cycles (dot-com bubble, anyone?) to know what's real and what's noise.</p>
                <p class="final-statement"><strong>Look, I'm not just adapting to the AI age. Turns out I've been training for it my whole life. Let's figure this out together.</strong></p>
