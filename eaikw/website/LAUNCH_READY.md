This website transformation positions you perfectly for what you're actually building:

1. **Academic credibility** (NJIT director, program creator)
2. **Thought leadership** (Everyday AI, Jordan Peterson of AI)
3. **Industry connections** (1,756 network, 455 decision makers)
4. **Production expertise** (43 years, GitHub portfolio)
5. **Teaching excellence** (students at Microsoft, JPMorgan, KPMG)

You're not selling consulting services aggressively. You're inviting people into a conversation about AI's transformation of work, education, and society.

**The consulting, training, and partnerships will come naturally from this positioning.**

Good luck with tomorrow's video! 🚀
