                    <h2>Who's Behind This</h2>
                    <p>I've been building software since 1982‚Äîstarted at age 7 on a TRS-80, back when debugging meant reading a 300-page manual and hoping you typed it right.</p>
                    <p>Fast forward 43 years: I've worked everywhere from startups to Fortune 500s, taught thousands of students at NJIT since 2003, and now direct the BS in Enterprise AI program.</p>
                    <p>I've lived through every tech hype cycle‚Äîdot-com bubble, cloud computing, mobile-first, now AI. Some changed everything. Some changed nothing. I can tell the difference.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why Everyday AI?</strong> Because the conversation about AI is broken. Too much hype from vendors selling dreams. Too much doom from people who don't build things. Not enough honest talk from people who've actually been in the trenches.</p>
                    <p>So I'm doing these lectures. No agenda except the truth. Come argue with me if you disagree.</p>

                    <p>Companies have all the AI technology they could want. What they don't have? People who can actually implement it in the real world. There's this massive gap between "cool AI demo" and "production system that doesn't fall apart on Tuesday."</p>

                    <h3>Here's Why I'm Uniquely Positioned (And Maybe a Little Dangerous üòè)</h3>
                    <p>Look, I learned programming the hard way. Started at age 7 on a TRS-80 in 1982‚Äîbefore Stack Overflow existed, before GitHub, definitely before ChatGPT. Just me, a manual that weighed more than I did, and a lot of frustrated typing.</p>
                    <p><strong>All those years of doing things the hard way? Turns out that's my superpower now.</strong></p>
                    <p>Because when you combine <em>43 years of hard-won knowledge</em> with <em>AI amplification</em>, you become something rare: someone who knows <strong>what to ask for</strong>, <strong>what's actually possible</strong>, and <strong>what's complete bullshit</strong>. (And trust me, there's a LOT of bullshit out there right now.)</p>

                            <h4>I'm Fast Now. Like, Scary Fast.</h4>
                            <p>I can architect systems in hours that used to take weeks‚Äîbecause I actually know what I'm building toward. Junior devs with AI write more code faster. Cool. I write the <em>right code</em> faster. There's a difference.</p>

                            <p>You know that gut feeling when something's about to break? That's 43 years of pattern recognition. AI helps me query my mental database of "what fails and why" instantly. I spot problems in your architecture before you deploy it.</p>

                            <p>Most people treat AI like a magic 8-ball. I treat it like a really smart junior engineer who needs clear direction. There's a skill to that. I know what's possible, what's fantasy, and what's a vendor trying to sell you something that doesn't exist yet.</p>

                            <p>When AI hallucinates, I catch it instantly. When vendors pitch "revolutionary AI solutions," I can tell you which parts are real and which parts are marketing. When hype drowns out reality, I'm the guy going "Okay, but does it actually WORK?"</p>

                    <h3>Practice Builds Theory</h3>
                    <p>I started coding at age 7 on a TRS-80. I believe in learning by building, not theorizing endlessly. Theory without practice is philosophy. Practice without theory is chaos. AI helps me bridge both‚Äîfast.</p>

                    <p>The gap between academic AI courses and what companies actually need is enormous. We're fixing that at NJIT‚Äîteaching students to think like engineers who've been doing this for decades, but with AI tools from day one.</p>

                    <p>Bias, displacement, power concentration‚Äîthese aren't side issues. They're the main event. I've seen enough technology cycles to know: the people who build responsibly win in the long run.</p>

                    <h3>Societal Impact Matters</h3>
                    <p>AI will reshape work, education, and economic structures. We need honest conversations, not hype. I'm old enough to remember when "the internet will replace everything" was said with the same breathless certainty. Some things changed. Some didn't. Let's think clearly.</p>

            <div class="solution-box">
                <h3>So What Does This Mean for You?</h3>
                <p><strong>If you're running a company:</strong> You get someone who can architect AI systems that actually work in production‚Äînot just pretty demos. I've been shipping code for 43 years. AI just makes me faster and more creative, not sloppier.</p>
                <p><strong>If you're a student:</strong> You learn from someone who made all the mistakes already (trust me, I made a LOT of them). You get the foundations that matter, taught by someone who learned the hard way so you don't have to. Plus I'll probably tell you some stories that aren't in the textbook.</p>
                <p><strong>If you're just trying to make sense of AI:</strong> You get honest talk. No hype. No doom-saying. No oversimplification. Just someone who's lived through enough tech cycles (dot-com bubble, anyone?) to know what's real and what's noise.</p>
                <p class="final-statement"><strong>Look, I'm not just adapting to the AI age. Turns out I've been training for it my whole life. Let's figure this out together.</strong></p>
