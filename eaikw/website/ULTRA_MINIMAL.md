## The Message

**Old version said:** "Look at all my credentials, connections, repos, and experience. I'm impressive!"

**New version says:** "I'm doing free lectures about AI. Want to come? Here's how to stay updated."

---

## User Journey (Simplified)

1. **Awareness:** Hears about Keith's lecture series (LinkedIn, word of mouth, email)
2. **Visit site:** Sees simple message - free lectures about AI, no hype
3. **Interest:** Reads what topics are covered
4. **Action:** Gives email/connects on LinkedIn to get notified
5. **Conversion:** Attends first lecture
6. **Engagement:** Joins Discord community (announced at lecture)
7. **Advocacy:** Brings colleagues to next lecture

Site's only job: **Get people to step 4 (stay updated for lecture)**

---

- Teaching impact stories
- NJIT program details (outcomes, partnerships)

## Why This Works

### Principle: "People know who I am"
- Your network already knows your credentials
- Former students know you can teach
- Colleagues know your experience
- No need to prove it on the website

### Focus: One clear action
- Before: 10 different things you could do (partner, consult, hire, follow, attend, etc.)
- After: 1 thing to do - stay updated for lecture

### Trust: Less is more credible
- Bragging looks insecure
- Simplicity looks confident
- "I'm doing lectures" > "Here's why I'm qualified to do lectures"

### Speed: 30 seconds to understand
- Before: 5+ minutes to read everything
- After: 30 seconds to get the point
- People make decisions faster

## Reactivation Strategy

When you want to add things back:

### Phase 1 (Now - Launch):
- Keep minimal
- Get lecture date set
- Start building email list

### Phase 2 (After 1st lecture):
- Add testimonials FROM ATTENDEES
- "Here's what people said about the first lecture"
- Social proof from actual experience

### Phase 3 (After 3-5 lectures):
- Reactivate Everyday AI content showcase
- Show best clips/posts from lecture series
- Prove concept with real content

### Phase 4 (If consulting becomes focus):
- Reactivate Services section
- Add "Work with me" for corporate training
- Only AFTER thought leadership is established

### Never reactivate (probably):
- Network Intelligence (too inside-baseball)
- GitHub deep dive (too technical for general audience)
- Long "Why I'm Positioned" section (overexplains)

## Success Metrics

**Before (impossible to measure):**
- Which CTA did they click?
- Did they partner, hire, consult, follow, or attend?
- Too many conversion paths

**After (crystal clear):**
- How many stayed updated (email/LinkedIn)?
- How many attended first lecture?
- How many brought colleagues to second lecture?

## The Psychology

**Abundance mindset vs. Scarcity:**
- Scarcity: "Let me prove I'm qualified" (insecure)
- Abundance: "I'm doing this thing. Want in?" (confident)

**Pull vs. Push:**
- Push: "Here are 10 reasons to work with me"
- Pull: "I'm doing something interesting. Stay tuned."

**Action vs. Information:**
- Information: "Learn about my background, credentials, repos, network"
- Action: "Get notified when the lecture is scheduled"

People don't need information. They need a clear next step.
